## About the project

This library was originaly developed by Peter Minne and published on http://code.google.com/p/zend-framework-matrixcode-module/
As author has no time to maintain the project I have forked it on GitHub. First thing I did was removing the Zend namespace as it's not a part of the framework and it's not related to Zend Company.
